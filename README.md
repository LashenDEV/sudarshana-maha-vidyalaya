_Sri Lanka is a developing country that doesn't yet use much technology. When it comes to schools, nearly most of them
still lack technological systems. This project was created for Sudarshana Maha Vidyalaya using minimal technologies and
tools. We are expected to provide users with details, history, achievements, contact information, and other information
about the school through this website._

**For Development**

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```

Great, everything is set up! ðŸŽ‰
